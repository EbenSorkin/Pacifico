Aloha! Pacifico is an original and fun brush script handwriting font by Vernon Adams which was inspired by the 1950s American surf culture in 2011. It was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly at Baron von Fonthausen in 2016. It was expanded to Cyrillic by Botjo Nikoltchev and Ani Petrova at Lettersoup in 2017. Raphael Alegbeleye CH and Eben Sorkin expanded the Latin in 2023.

The Pacifico project was commissioned by Google from Vernon Adams, an English type designer who lived in San Clemente, Los Angeles, USA. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Pacifico
